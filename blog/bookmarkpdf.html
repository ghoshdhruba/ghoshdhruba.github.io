Nobody likes having PDFs with no bookmarks (or an index as you might call it), but that won't be a problem any more!
All we need is the <code>pdftk</code> utility (it has a ton of other uses as well).
</p>

<p>
Suppose the PDF we're working with is called <code>foo.pdf</code>.
Enter the following line in a terminal
<pre><code>
pdftk foo.pdf dump_data output bookmark.txt
            </pre></code>
            This will create a file called <code>bookmark.txt</code> containing various data about <code>foo.pdf</code>.
            Now open <code>bookmark.txt</code> using your favorite editor, and insert the following piece of code at the top (or bottom):
            <pre><code>
BookmarkBegin
BookmarkTitle: Page Cover
BookmarkLevel: 1
BookmarkPageNumber: 1
        </pre></code>
        Exit the editor and enter
        <pre><code>
pdftk foo.pdf update_info bookmark.txt output bookmarked.pdf
    </pre></code>
    If we open <code>bookmarked.pdf</code>, we'll see the contents of <code>foo.pdf</code> but this time there's a bookmark section with the entry "Page Cover" pointing to page 1.
    You can continue to add more bookmarks as you deem necessary.

    <p>
    <i>Note:</i> As far as I know, there's also a GUI version of <code>pdftk</code>, but I've never tried it out.
