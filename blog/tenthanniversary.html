title: 10 Years of Indian Classical Music
header: Ten Years of listening to Indian Classical Music
---

<p>
I started listening to Hindustani Classical Music in 2014.
My parents had occassionally tried to make me listen to various recitals before, but the slow pace of the compositions failed to capture my attention.
I had started playing the tabla much earlier, in 2008, but that was because my parents persuded me to.
</p>

<p>
After 6 years of playing without much interest, I suddenly came across Dr. L. Subramaniam's fast-paced Brova Barama.
I remember that it was the only recital that I listened to for a couple of days.
Curious to know if there was any other performance that would be as intriguing, I started listening to other instruments as well.

<p>
After 10 years, I think I am in a good place to share some of my favorite performances.
